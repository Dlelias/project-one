# <roomFinder>
## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
- We are motiviated by the struggle. Finding a good place that fits our budget, commute and lifestyles can be difficult. 
- So we built roomFinder to get rid of all the guess work. We built roomFinder with ease of use in mind.
- On roomFinder users can explore housing options nationwide, connect with those who inhabit the space and select from an array of local experiences to make new friends.
