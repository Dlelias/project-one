## Description

Live application deployed at:https://asharif123.github.io/project-one/

*** What is RoomFinder?**

A website to search for a new place to live.

***Why RoomFinder?***

On RoomFinder, users can explore housing options nationwide. The motivation for this project originated from the stress of looking for new place that fits our budget. For Example, the user could be looking for something close to work or simply looking for an entirely new location. Whatever the reason or cause the objective of our project is to simplfy the search. We are using 3 key components for user search. The user will search by the state of interest, the city of interest, and most importantly their budget. Searching for a new place can take time and a lot of research. The user will be presented with mulitple options containing: addresses, images, and budget. Our users will have the option to save their searches, so they may later revist certain properties that caught their eye during a previous search.

*** How does RoomFinder work?**

When the user visits the homepage they will find a user friendly interface. 

The user will be present with a form, which they will need enter the state, city, and budget.
